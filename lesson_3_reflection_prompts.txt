Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork happens on Github, taking a copy of another's repository to store a copy in your own area. 
A clone is a copy of a repository, typically used to describe downloading a repository to a local host.
A branch is a way of creating an alternate path on an existing repository, typically used as a way to try out new ideas.
