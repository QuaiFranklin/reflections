What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a Git repository it sets up a .git folder and prepares the current directory for commits 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory in that the staging area is a subset that only contains objects you've specifically added to it. I think the staging area offers the value of having a phase in which you can examine the files you have added into that context before going on to commit them.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change, by making the change, then using git add to add the changed file to the staging area. Then when you use git status you can see what files have changed but not yet commited.
